"# VentureMineBackend" 

The backend for VentureMine, using Node.JS to manage live auctions and their data, updating information on the fly, and interacting with our remote MongoDB database.


This server is a work in progress and built for demonstration purposes, not full fledged platform capabilities. One day we will get there!
